        <h2>What is Jerry the Writer website?</h2>
        <p>This is a website where I help make student life easier by; providing guides to help; new students write quality assignments, busy students complete assignments fast and for those unable to write assignments for whatever reason, I work
          directly with them by writing quality papers for them. I will also feature a blog and partner with some experts to share advice on living an enjoyable school life.</p>
        <h2>Why Jerry the Writer?</h2>
        <p>I have worked directly with students for over 7 years, helping them complete their assignments. My initial years were difficult, as I had to learn the ins and outs of writing quality assignments. Years later, I am able to complete just
          about any assignment (apart from technical papers, example.; I.T assignments). My rates are cheaper than most services, and I am not entirely after the money. I hope to make great friends along the way. Check the site and get anything that
          will be useful to make your life easier, more fulfilling and more liberating, as you owe to yourself.</p>
        <h2>Is Jerry the Writer legal?</h2>
        <p>Yes, completely. This site is legal. I, Jerry, the complete owner of the site will not tolerate plagiarism. I will provide students with samples of assignments and assistance with their research, so as to help them perfect their skills in
          writing essays. </p>

        <h2>What do you do to prevent problems from coming up? And which problems in this case?</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism: I use a plagiarism checker software, (Turnitin- used by educational institutions) and attach the plagiarism report with your assignment. For grammar, I use Grammarly, a grammar checking software to crosscheck grammar. Every
          paper will be well formatted according to instructions, and, you will get the outline for the paper, to show the paper was written from </p>
